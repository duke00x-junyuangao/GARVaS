#' Generate The 1st Generation of the Genetic Algorithm
#'

#' @param C chromosome length (Number of Variables in the data)
#' @details This function produces first generation given the chromosome length for Genetic Algorithm. The row of
#' generated booleans matrix represents locus of a gene(variable), and the column of the matrix represents different member
#' of the first generation(different models). The number of first generation is defined by minimum(2C,50).
